    "Speedy service is of utmost importance in McDonaldâ€™s (McD) fast-food restaurants. However, mistakes often come with speed, such as in the form of incorrect orders. Such situations lead to customer dissatisfaction and loss of efficiency as staff triage the situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Six hundred people were surveyed, and 31% said McDonald's messes up their orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "To tackle this issue, we leverage object detection models. Our object detection model will detect the items on the food tray and cross-check them against the order receipt. The whole process will be automated and essentially make human error 0.\n",
    "This mechanism will be deployed at the pick-up counter right before the customer is alerted to collect their order."

    "We will focus on building the object detection model to return one/more instances of the object(s) in frame. We will be limiting our object detection to the following three classes: burgers, drinks, and fries. \n",
    "\n",
    "We intend to build a dataset that consists of images of McD food items on trays. We will only consider images that are still properly in their packaging and on trays, as the order will have just come out of the kitchen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this dataset, we will train a variety of models to detect the McD food items in each image. For this, we have chosen to implement and train three neural network models, a vanilla R-CNN model, a Fast R-CNN model, and a YOLO model."

    "We have created our models to be scaled to any number of classes. Making it easier for it to adapt to different fast-food chains.\n",
